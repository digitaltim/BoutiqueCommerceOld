1) work on todo list

- In /utilities/functions.php
--- isLiveServer() ?

- DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-- should prebuild be inside Src?
-- should public be outside Src? Perhaps with index.php remaining inside somewhere...
-- where will we put js files for admin functionality and how would that be secure?
-- where should we put css files for admin?

- DO I UNDERSTAND THE FRAMEWORK
-- What does registering controller / factories in dependencies do? When they are commented out the script still runs. it makes them available to use in controllers or views (wherever the container is passed). some testing probably still in order on this.
-- What services need instantiation in base classes, ex. Controller and AdminView? (plus DRY)

- DOCUMENTATION
-- Build docs section in nav...
--- structure (which docs will be displayed in the admin nav section (help) and which in the GitHub page (developer resources)?)
-- Create installation instructions

- How should gulp autogenerated files be handled in version control? Ex. commits for js/scss mods (get .map files - ignore? what about frontend js/css?) (This appears to be a setup/install issue where we define how to use and setup gulp... Needs to be defined in the installation instructions)

- Create database backup script by modifying existing script. Add instructions how to use. Ex. (cron?)

- Configure application/apache to ignore trailing slashes in URLs

- CODING STANDARDS
-- Should we use docblocks for all classes, methods, properties (?)
-- use typehints on params and return params

- INFRASTRUCTURE
-- how to prevent xss from rogue admins? (chunk of html problem: https://www.perl.com/pub/2002/02/20/css.html). does twig prevent it or does |raw thwart that? => using |raw is potentiall unsafe: https://vivait.co.uk/labs/safely-escape-twigs-json_encode-without-using-raw
-- fork infrastructure to a new repo
-- the schema should only contain the admins table and maybe a test table in the forked repo
