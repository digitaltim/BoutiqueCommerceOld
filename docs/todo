1) work on todo list

- Create database backup script by modifying existing script. Add instructions how to use. Ex. (cron?)

- DO I UNDERSTAND THE FRAMEWORK
-- What does registering controller / factories in dependencies do? When they are commented out the script still runs. it makes them available to use in controllers or views (wherever the container is passed). some testing probably still in order on this.
-- What services need instantiation in base classes, ex. Controller and AdminView? (plus DRY)

- DOCUMENTATION
-- Build docs section in nav...
--- structure (which docs will be displayed in the admin nav section (help) and which in the GitHub page (developer resources)?)
-- Create installation instructions

- INFRASTRUCTURE
-- fork infrastructure to a new repo
-- the schema should only contain the admins table and maybe a test table in the forked repo
