-Explain directory structure in architecture doc
-Improve directory structure if necessary
--Note (GC): I think docs, node_modules, prebuild, and probably gulpfile.js and schema.sql belong in a top level dir of their own like "non-app" or "resources" or we could use "app" for everything else, but that may be hairy
-using typehints on params and return params
-docblocks for all classes, methods, properties (?)
-Group the routes
-search todo in code and do
-Create installation instructions
--composer update
--node gulp node_modules
